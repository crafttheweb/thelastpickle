Recently, we got invited to speak at [StampedeCon](http://stampedecon.com/), a "Big Data conference series" hosted at Washington University in St. Louis. It had been a while since I'd presented, but I was really looking forward to this as it brought me back to one of the things I like to do most which is evangelize Apache Cassandra to new users.

StampedeCon itself was an interesting mix of folks:

- Academia and research from the university (particularly folks in epidemiology)
- Big industry (and the systems integrators who love them)
- Some local startups (of which St. Louis had a surprising amount)

The schedule was well thought out with two days of hands-on tutorials (including an excellent Cassandra one tought by TLP pal [Sameer Farooqui](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=16631295)) followed by two days of presentations. There were good opportunities for networking sprinkled throughout.

Given the mix of the crowd and the number of folks new to Big Data, I went high-level and focused my presentation on three real-world use cases of Cassandra and a distilled list of best practices from such.

The presentation is online [here](http://www.slideshare.net/zznate/stampede-con-2014-cassandra-in-the-real-world). It's a quick read through and, even if you've been working with Cassandra for a while, may contain some things you don't know.

As always, we are open to comments and suggestions on anything we publish, so let us know what you think.
