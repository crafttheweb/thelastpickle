One of the things every Cassandra developer should know and regularly practice is using the `cassandra-stress` tool to benchmark schemas and configuration changes before pushing them out to production.

But wouldn't it be nice if you could graph the output of it?

## Graph it!

Using cassandra-stress today at its simplest involves something along the lines of…
```
cassandra-stress write n=10000 -rate threads=10
cassandra-stress mixed n=10000 -rate threads=10
```
The output of this is rather old-school looking like
```
Created keyspaces. Sleeping 1s for propagation.
Sleeping 2s...
Warming up WRITE with 50000 iterations...

END
```
There's a lot of useful information here especially in the summary. But making effecient use of that middle section is cumbersome especially when the `n=` option becomes a much larger and more realistic stress number. Comparing consistency of latency numbers or investigating how 99th percentile latencies come about involves a bit of digging.

The lack of graphing ability to cassandra-stress was (raised)[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-7918]¹ over a year ago by (Benedict)[http://belliottsmith.com/] as DataStax's big brother to cassandra-stress: (cstar_perf)[https://github.com/datastax/cstar_perf] has such graphing ability already and to which graphs you've probably seen before attached to various Cassandra jira issues and Planet Cassandra blog posts.

Once the patch from (CASSANDRA-7918)[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-7918], or if you're willing to checkout (engima curry's cassandra fork)[https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/cassandra/tree/7918-stress-graph] and build it yourself, to generate pretty graphs with cassandra-stress is as simple² as…
```
cassandra-stress write n=100000 -rate threads=10 -graph file=example-benchmark.html title=example revision=benchmark-0
cassandra-stress mixed n=100000 -rate threads=10 -graph file=example-benchmark.html title=example revision=benchmark-0
```
Now in the current directory you'll find a example-benchmark.html file. 
Opening this shows the pretty graphs with both write and read benchmarks for the "benchmark-0" revision. In the following image the revision is named "cassandra-2.0.16-lenovo-x1-carbon" and the number of requests was increased to ten million.
!graph-0.png! !graph-1.png!
The nice thing about this html file is that it's completely standalone so sharing it and posting it to jira issues is a practical thing to do. On top of that you just keep running further benchmarks with new revision names and they'll get added to the existing graph.
For example let's run a new benchmark revision
```
cassandra-stress write n=100000 -rate threads=10 -graph file=example-benchmark.html title=example revision=benchmark-1
cassandra-stress mixed n=100000 -rate threads=10 -graph file=example-benchmark.html title=example revision=benchmark-1
```
Refresh the graph and you see the comparison clearly between the two revisions. In this image I added three new revisions "cassandra-2.1.5-lenovo-x1-carbon", "cassandra-2.2.1-lenovo-x1-carbon", and "cassandra-3.0.0-rc1-lenovo-x1-carbon".

Building insightful eyecandy for your peers is so simple now.

¹ Benedict in fact went further in raising the need for graphing more than want cstart_perf does today, which seems to also be in the works now.
² When running cassandra-stress you need to run the benchmark, and each revision, first in write mode. Once that is finished then you are free to run in read or mixed mode.
