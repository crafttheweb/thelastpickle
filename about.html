        <h1>Who We Are</h1>

<p>TLP aims to be the premier services and consultancy firm for Apache Cassandra. Our goal is to work as closely as possible with our clients in order to ensure that they take advantage of the benefits of using Cassandra on their projects while avoiding pitfalls common to many operations and development teams.</p>

<p>TLP employees are all active members of the Cassandra community, participating on the project directly as well as on many of those projects considered complimentary to the ecosystem. We are the only services firm for Cassandra where community participation is a requirement of the employees.</p>

<p>We feel strongly that this type of community engagement is the only way to gain real expertise on this or any open source project.</p>
