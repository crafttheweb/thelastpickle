Today I will talking at the [Cassandra Summit Tokyo](http://cassandra-jp.com/) on upgrading Apache Cassandra. 

The talk covers a little on why and when to upgrade, but spends most of the time discussion how to upgrade from Cassandra 1.2 to 2.0. 

The slides are available [here](/files/2015-04-15-Cassandra-jp-2015/Cassandra_JP_2015-Problem_Free_Cassandra_Upgrades.pdf) and the run book discussed is [here](/files/2015-04-15-Cassandra-jp-2015/TLP-CassandraJPUpgradeRunbook-210415-1916.pdf).

The run book is meant to be a general approach for upgrading. If you grab it be sure to check back for updates.
