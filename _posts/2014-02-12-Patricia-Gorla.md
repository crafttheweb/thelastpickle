I'm happy to announce that [Patricia Gorla](http://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciagorla) has joined The Last Pickle. We first noticed Patricia due to her community involvement, including talking at Hadoop World New York and the Cassandra Summit in London. Prior to joining TLP she spent her time at [OpenSource Connections](http://www.opensourceconnections.com/) helping customers with Solr and Cassandra. 

Patricia brings a new perspective to The Last Pickle. While Nate and I formed some of our opinions back at version 0.5; her experience with version 1.0+ is of a mature platform clients can depend on. We look forward to working with her and benefiting from having another voice contributing to our discussions.
