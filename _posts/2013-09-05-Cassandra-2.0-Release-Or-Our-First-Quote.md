We got our first [press release](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces44) quote! 
 

>"We are excited about the future Apache Cassandra 2.0 makes possible. Paying down a lot of the technical debt accumulated over 5 years of intense Open Source development, and solidifying the Native Binary Transport for CQL 3, has put the project on a great footing," said Aaron Morton, Apache Cassandra committer and Co-Founder & Principal Consultant of The Last Pickle. "The addition of Lightweight 'Compare-and-Set' Transactions and Cursors brings another set of features that make it easier for developers to harness the performance and scale of Cassandra. And the experimental Trigger support will allow Open Source contributors to provide feedback for this often requested feature."


But seriously, like pretty much everyone else in the community, we are very glad 2.0 is here. Picking through the fluff above, here is a bit more detail about the contents of our quote:

- good, bad and ugly cassandra been in active open source development for over 5 years! This is a good milestone in any software project
- there has indeed been some pay down on technical debt particularly [around streaming](http://www.planetcassandra.org/blog/post/streaming--in-cassandra-20) and the removal of super columns
- with the binary transport improvements for CQL3.1 batches particularly become a lot easier
- CAS: also known as paxos, this will provide for transactional semantics 
- cursors will make everyone who ever had to "page" slices very happy
- triggers allow for server-side functionality. I wrote some more details back in [this post](http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2013/08/20/Cassandra-2.0-Meetup-ReCap.html) 
- more performant [thrift transport](https://github.com/xedin/disruptor_thrift_server) (I threw that one in there because it's one of my personal favorites) based on the LMAX Disruptor thread library  

These are being covered pretty well on the inter webs already (as well as a lot of things we didn't mention, see [Planet Cassandra](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/whats-under-the-hood-in-cassandra-2-0) for a good writeup), so we'll keep this post on the short side. In sum, we are really looking forwarding to helping our customers and the community transition to the next generation of Cassandra.
