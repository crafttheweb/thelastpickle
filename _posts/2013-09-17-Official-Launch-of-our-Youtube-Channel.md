Community engagement and participation is [pretty import](http://thelastpickle.com/about.html) to us here at TLP. Thus, we are heavily involved in participating in and organizing [local](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-Cassandra-Users/) [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Driven-Wellington/) [groups](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-Hadoop-Users-Group-AHUG/). To further this endeavor, we recently went out and bought some video cameras (consumer grade, nothing fancy) in an effort to get further reach for, what we think anyway, is valuable content.

Therefore, without further ado, we present our very own Youtube channel: [http://www.youtube.com/TheLastPickleMedia](http://www.youtube.com/TheLastPickleMedia). 

We have three videos up there currently - all from recent meetups in the Austin, TX area. We'll be adding more content as we continue to attend and organize locally. We will of course be focusing on Apache Cassandra and immediately related technologies, but expect occasional python or DevOps meetups to show up as well. 

Additionally, we'll have a series of shorter-form screen casts coming out, demonstrating some common operational and programming how-tos with Cassandra.
