I've tidied up a previous Introduction to Cassandra presentation with better diagrams and improved explanations. It's available as [Keynote](/files/2011-02-07-introduction-to-cassandra/introduction-to-cassandra.key), [PDF](/files/2011-02-07-introduction-to-cassandra/introduction-to-cassandra.pdf) or plain old [web pages](/files/2011-02-07-introduction-to-cassandra/introduction-to-cassandra.html). It's a basic introduction to the way Cassandra works as a clustered system. It covers Partitioning, Replication, Hinted Handoff, Read Repair and Anti Entrophy. It does not cover the data model.

Presentation classic is still [here](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/well-railedcassandra24112010-5901169) 

If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. You can also [use it](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/deed.en) as a starting point if you are creating a Cassandra presentation of your own.
