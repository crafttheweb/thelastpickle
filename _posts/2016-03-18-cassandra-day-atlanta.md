Nate and I got to speak at the [DataStax Cassandra Day Atlanta](https://atlcassandraday2016.sched.org) yesterday. It was great to see so many people (a few hundred by my count) interested in Cassandra outside of San Francisco. 

Nate spoke about [Hardening Cassandra For Compliance (Or Paranoia)](http://www.slideshare.net/zznate/seattle-c-meetup-hardening-cassandra-for-compliance-or-paranoia), and I presented an introduction on [Monitoring Cassandra](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/cassandra-day-atlanta-2016-monitoring-cassandra). 

Thanks to everyone who attended, please [reach out](http://thelastpickle.com/about.html) if you have any questions.
