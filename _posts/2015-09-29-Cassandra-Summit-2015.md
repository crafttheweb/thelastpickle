The whole TLP team had a great week at the [Cassandra Summit](http://cassandrasummit-datastax.com) in Santa Clara last week. Between us we have attended every Cassandra conference in the world, and this was by far the biggest and most inspiring.

The slides for the four talks the team presented are below:

* [Nate McCall: Hardening Apache Cassandra for Compliance (or Paranoia)](http://www.slideshare.net/zznate/hardening-cassandra-for-compliance-or-paranoia)
* [Mick Semb Wever: Distributed Tracing from Application to Database](http://thelastpickle.com/files/2015-09-24-using-zipkin-for-full-stack-tracing-including-cassandra/presentation/tlp-reveal.js/tlp-cassandra-zipkin.html#/)
* [Aaron Morton: Steady State Data Size with Compaction, Tombstones, and TTL](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/cassandra-sf-2015-steady-state-data-size-with-compaction-tombstones-and-ttl)
* [Aaron Morton: Repeatable, Scalable, Reliable, Observable Cassandra](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/cassandra-sf-2015-repeatable-scalable-reliable-observable-cassandra)
