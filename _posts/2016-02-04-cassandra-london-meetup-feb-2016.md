Had a great time catching up with people at the [London Cassandra Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cassandra-London/) last night. 

I jumped onto the end of a full night of talks to do a five minute lightening talk about [Incremental Repairs](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs). 

The [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/cassandra-london-march-2016-lightening-talk-introduction-to-incremental-repair-57866362) is available, if a little sparse. Feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/aaronmorton) me you have any questions.
