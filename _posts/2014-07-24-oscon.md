# OSCON Review

Earlier this week I had the privilege of speaking at O'Reilly's OSCON in Portland, a yearly conference dedicated to the world of open source software. Talks varied from exploring terminal emulators, to engaging software communities. More than <x> people attended, <xx>% of which were women. This marks one of the <most diverse> OSCONs / conferences I've attended.	

This year I talked about using <Riemann> to monitor your Cassandra cluster. Every node added is another moving piece to monitor, and Riemann gives you the ability to aggregate metrics across all nodes in your system.

You can find the slides for my talk on monitoring Cassandra with Riemann on Slideshare <here>.
