Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at O'Reilly's OSCON conference in Portland. This was my first year at OSCON, and I had a great time.

A quick overview of my experience:

- I met many people from all parts of the open source community.
- There was a wide variety of sessions and tutorials presented by really good speakers.
- Of all of the conferences I have attended, OSCON 2014 had the greatest percentage of women as speakers and attendees.

As for [my talk](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34587), I discussed how to track your Cassandra cluster's performance using [Riemann](http://riemann.io), a Clojure-based monitoring system. Paired with AddThis' [metrics-reporter-config](https://github.com/addthis/metrics-reporter-config), Cassandra can be set up to stream metrics to a custom reporter. Riemann, along with a graphing tool, can then be used to aggregate metrics across nodes with ease.
