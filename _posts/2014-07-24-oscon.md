Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at O'Reilly's OSCON conference in Portland. This was my first year at OSCON, and I met many people from all walks of the open source industry. Another noteworthy feature -- of all of the conferences I have attended, this year's lineup had the greatest percentage of women as speakers and attendees.

My talk discussed how to track your Cassandra cluster's performance using [Riemann](http://riemann.io), a Clojure-based monitoring system. Paired with AddThis' [metrics-reporter-config](https://github.com/addthis/metrics-reporter-config), Cassandra can be set up to stream metrics to a custom reporter. Riemann, along with a graphing tool, can then be used to aggregate metrics across nodes with ease.
