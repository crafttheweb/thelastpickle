While in Sydney I got the opportunity to catch up with some Australian Cassandra users at the [Sydney Cassandra Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Cassandra-Users/events/226925606/). Adoption down under has been a bit behind the ball. That seems to be changing with the presence of DataStax and InstaClustr, and a catching on of the global trend in finances and the top-end of businesses.

The evening was hosted in The Rocks at RoZetta Technology underneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I had the honours of being the only presenter for the evening and to talk for close to an hour on *[Taking the Pain out of Repairs](http://www.thelastpickle.com/files/2016-02-17-taking-the-pain-out-of-repairs/tlp-cassandra-repairs.html)*. It was the topic we (TLP) thought would best suit the crowd, largely people still getting the hang of Cassandra in production. I enjoyed being back in the city I grew up in and the crowd was a great bunch, warm and relaxed with plenty of questions and discussion.

The [slide deck](http://www.thelastpickle.com/files/2016-02-17-taking-the-pain-out-of-repairs/tlp-cassandra-repairs.html) is available, and I hope to write up a longer blog post with more of the details soon. Of course in the meantime feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/mck_sw) me you have any questions.

And a big Thank You for [RoZetta Software](https://twitter.com/RoZetta_Tech), [Sirca](http://www.sirca.org.au) and [DataStax](https://twitter.com/tim_steele) for hosting the night.
