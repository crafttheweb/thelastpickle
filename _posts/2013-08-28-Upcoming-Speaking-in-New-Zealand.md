**Updated:** Unfortunately I have had to cancel these speaking engagements due to family commitments. 

I'll be speaking at the [Wellington .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/WelliDotNet/events/126497992/) on September 4th. Come along if you are interested in learning about Cassandra and the latest [.NET driver](https://github.com/datastax/csharp-driver) from [DataStax](http://www.datastax.com/) for CQL3. I spent a lot of time using MS SQL Server when I was younger, so fire away with "How is this different to SQL Server" type questions. 

Next I'll be presenting [Cassandra & Python: State of the Nation](http://nz.pycon.org/schedule/presentation/30/) at [Kiwi PyCon 2013](http://nz.pycon.org/) in Auckland on September 8th. This will be an overview of how Cassandra works and a look at the new [Python CQL3 driver](https://github.com/datastax/python-driver) from [DataStax](http://www.datastax.com/).
