I finally got a chance last night to make it back to [Austin's Cassandra Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-Cassandra-Users/events/226865616/) group and present a newer version of my [Hardening Cassandra talk](http://www.slideshare.net/zznate/seattle-c-meetup-hardening-cassandra-for-compliance-or-paranoia). I really like going to this group when I can, because we get a wide variety of skill sets and backgrounds. Austin is just eclectic like that!

Unlike my experience with this topic [in Seattle last month](http://thelastpickle.com/speaking/2016/01/20/hardening-cassandra-clusters-for-compliance-or-paranoia.html) where we had a lot of active Cassandra users with little security knowledge, most folks in the room had security backgrounds, but were new to Cassandra and had been tasked with hardening a new cluster. It was a good fit and I'm pretty sure attendees got what they needed.

If securing Cassandra is a topic of interest to you, please see some of my previous posts on [logging exposure](http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2016/02/10/locking-down-apache-cassandra-logging.html) and [node to node encryption](http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2015/09/30/hardening-cassandra-step-by-step-part-1-server-to-server.html). As always, feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/zznate) at me you have any questions on this.
