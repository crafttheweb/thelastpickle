In March was able to speak at two community meetups in the San Francisco area.

I expanded on the previous post about the [3.0 storage engine](http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2016/03/04/introductiont-to-the-apache-cassandra-3-storage-engine.html) at the [San Francisco Cassandra User Group](http://www.meetup.com/CassandraSF/events/224881549/). Slides for this talk are available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/cassandra-sf-meetup-cql-performance-with-apache-cassandra-3x). 

The next was at the South Bay Cassandra User Group where I was joined by the team at [DatosIO](http://datos.io) to talk about [Backup and Restore for Apache Cassandra](http://www.meetup.com/DataStax-Cassandra-South-Bay-Users/events/229421102/). My slides for this talk are available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/aaronmorton/cassandra-south-bay-meetup-backup-and-restore-for-apache-cassandra).
