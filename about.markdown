I'm a Freelance Developer based in [Wellington](http://www.wellingtonnz.com) New Zealand, a [Committer](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Committers) on the [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) project and a Data Stax [MVP](http://www.datastax.com/mvp) for Apache Cassandra. 

In [2010](http://nz.linkedin.com/pub/aaron-morton/1/488/a9b) I gave up the RDBMS world for the scale and reliability of Cassandra. I now spend my time advancing the Cassandra project and [helping](http://www.mail-archive.com/search?a=1&l=user%40cassandra.apache.org&haswords=from%3A%22aaron+morton%22&from=&notwords=&subject=&datewithin=1d&date=&order=datenewest&search=Search) others get the best out of it.

I've available for hire as contract Cassandra developer to help with implementation, planning, troubleshooting or to sanity check your current plans.
